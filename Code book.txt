1 Code book
This is the code book for tidy data set

2 Variables Description
Data read from project data files. 

feature_list - features.txt file
activity - activity_labels.txt file
subject_test - subject_test.txt file
x_test - X_test.txt
y_test - Y_test.txt
subject_train - subject_train.txt
x_train - train/X_train.txt
y_train -train/Y_train.txt

3 Processing variables
y_test_label - match y_test labels with corresponding activities
tidy_test - binding test subject, test activity and test set
y_train_label - match y_train labels with corresponding activities
tidy_train - binding train subject, train activity and train set
tidy_set - merged test set and train set
tidy_mean_std - data set with only measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
tidy_avg - independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

4 Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names using gsub()

5.   From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
